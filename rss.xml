            <title><![CDATA[Backpacking in Australia]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Backpacking in Australia</h1><p>Not my first time traveling solo, but this time it's so much more legit in terms of "backpacking". Still a couple of days to go but i already don't want it to end. All the people I've met along the way had been so amazing, each with their own stories and background. Besides getting to meet new friends, I've also re-introduced myself to me (as cliche as this sounds). There were many things I never thought I could do such as sleeping in a hostel with a room full of strangers (for those who know me, I have my sleeping issues). It's just so relaxing being in a place where nobody knows who you are.
