For the solo traveler 

1\. Meet people

The amount of people you can meet are endless and they all come from different places with their own stories and backgrounds. Grab a drink and have a chat, don't be shy! 

2\. Bring only the essentials

You're going to be moving around most of the time and staying everywhere! As much as you want to look beautiful, bring only the necessities and you will thank yourself when you go up and down staircases...trust me ;)

3\. Get local

Besides hostels, stay at Airbnbs with hosts! You certainly won't know who you will meet, but if you are lucky like me you will come across amazing hosts that will give you the most local tips. Chat up with them and in return you can learn so much about their way of life.

4\. Stay safe, stay connected

This should go without saying. Be smart and use your best judgement. Even if you want to turn your phone off to enjoy some tranquil moments, you should still stay connected with your family and friends at least once a day so you don't keep them up at night.

5\. Appreciate 

Appreciate and be thankful why and how you are where you are. Cameras can capture a moment in time, but not the feelings and thoughts that accompany it. Don't just snap and go, open your eyes wherever you may be and just stay a little bit longer.

6\. Let it go

You're in a place where NOBODY knows you, enjoy those moments because they won't come around too often. This is the best time to just simply be yourself and be free. 

7\. Try something new

Often times we get so hesitant about trying new things only because we haven't done it before. Like the saying goes the "only thing we have to fear is fear itself". Just do it!
