The Grid is finally up and running! Yay!

Not my first time traveling solo, but this time it's so much more legit in terms of "backpacking". Still a couple of days in the trip but its been unreal from the people I've met to the things I've seen and done. Nobody likes to be outside their comfort zone and I'm no exception. I had so many doubts and hesitations the past couple of days, but I kept telling myself "you have nothing to lose raven". As cliche as this sounds, it works and I've done things that I never thought I could such as sleeping in a hostel filled with strangers (for those who know me well, I have my sleeping issues). TBC...
